# Project Short Write-up

## a. Where you enforced: cap, pause, roles
- **Cap enforcement:**  
  In `CampusCreditV2.sol`, minting is capped using OpenZeppelin’s `ERC20Capped`.  
  The `airdrop()` function calculates the total of all mint amounts and reverts with the
  custom error `CapExceeded` if the new total supply would exceed the cap.
- **Pause enforcement:**  
  The contract inherits `ERC20Pausable`.  
  Functions `pause()` and `unpause()` can only be called by accounts with the
  `PAUSER_ROLE` to halt or resume all token transfers.
- **Role enforcement:**  
  Using `AccessControl`, the contract defines:
  - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` for role management,
  - `MINTER_ROLE` required by `mint()` and `airdrop()`,
  - `PAUSER_ROLE` required by `pause()`/`unpause()`.  
  The `onlyRole` modifier ensures that only authorized accounts can call these functions.

## b. Why batch airdrop saved (or didn’t save) gas in your data
- The `airdrop.ts` script calls the single‑transaction `airdrop()` function to mint to multiple recipients.  
- It then performs the same distribution using individual `transfer()` calls and compares the gas usage.
- Because `airdrop()` verifies the cap once and executes all mints in a single transaction,
  it avoids repeated base transaction costs and signature checks.
- The console output from `airdrop.ts` shows the total gas used by both approaches and prints the approximate percentage saved by the batch call.

<br>

## c. Issues encountered
- No deployment or runtime issues were encountered during testing.
- The scripts (`deploy.ts`, `transfer-approve.ts`, `airdrop.ts`, `logs-query.ts`) executed successfully when correct environment variables were provided with the .env file.
- The `transfer-approve.ts` and `airdrop`  scripts by default send the transfer to their own address, making the balance after the transfer the same as before. 
- In order to send to a recipient address using `transfer-approve.ts`, the RECIPIENT variable must be set with a valid address in the .env file.
- In order to send to a recipient address using`airdrop.ts`, the address must be set in the script as an argument to the **getAddress()** function.

# Sample Hardhat 3 Beta Project (`node:test` and `viem`)

This project showcases a Hardhat 3 Beta project using the native Node.js test runner (`node:test`) and the `viem` library for Ethereum interactions.

To learn more about the Hardhat 3 Beta, please visit the [Getting Started guide](https://hardhat.org/docs/getting-started#getting-started-with-hardhat-3). To share your feedback, join our [Hardhat 3 Beta](https://hardhat.org/hardhat3-beta-telegram-group) Telegram group or [open an issue](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/new) in our GitHub issue tracker.

## Project Overview

This example project includes:

- A simple Hardhat configuration file.
- Foundry-compatible Solidity unit tests.
- TypeScript integration tests using [`node:test`](nodejs.org/api/test.html), the new Node.js native test runner, and [`viem`](https://viem.sh/).
- Examples demonstrating how to connect to different types of networks, including locally simulating OP mainnet.

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run all the tests in the project, execute the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

You can also selectively run the Solidity or `node:test` tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test solidity
npx hardhat test nodejs
```

### Make a deployment to Sepolia

This project includes an example Ignition module to deploy the contract. You can deploy this module to a locally simulated chain or to Sepolia.

To run the deployment to a local chain:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```

To run the deployment to Sepolia, you need an account with funds to send the transaction. The provided Hardhat configuration includes a Configuration Variable called `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY`, which you can use to set the private key of the account you want to use.

You can set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` variable using the `hardhat-keystore` plugin or by setting it as an environment variable.

To set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` config variable using `hardhat-keystore`:

```shell
npx hardhat keystore set SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

After setting the variable, you can run the deployment with the Sepolia network:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy --network sepolia ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```
